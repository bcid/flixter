### Notes
The process of getting information from the API proved to be challenging once again, and the introduction of a GridViewCell took a lot of calculations to implement correctly.

### Notes
It was difficult for me to understand how to use the API to access the movie poster so it took me long to figure out how to connect the urls from the json data and documentation to create a link to access the images necessary for the project.
